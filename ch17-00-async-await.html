<p>Many operations we ask the computer to do can take a while to finish. For
example, if you used a video editor to create a video of a family celebration,
exporting it could take anywhere from minutes to hours. Similarly, downloading a
video shared by someone in your family might take a long time. It would be nice
if we could do something else while we are waiting for those long-running
processes to complete.</p>
<p>The video export will use as much CPU and GPU power as it can. If you only had
one CPU core, and your operating system never paused that export until it
completed, you couldn’t do anything else on your computer while it was running.
That would be a pretty frustrating experience, though. Instead, your computer’s
operating system can—and does!—invisibly interrupt the export often enough to
let you get other work done along the way.</p>
<p>The file download is different. It does not take up very much CPU time. Instead,
the CPU needs to wait on data to arrive from the network. While you can start
reading the data once some of it is present, it might take a while for the rest
to show up. Even once the data is all present, a video can be quite large, so it
might take some time to load it all. Maybe it only takes a second or two—but
that’s a very long time for a modern processor, which can do billions of
operations every second. It would be nice to be able to put the CPU to use for
other work while waiting for the network call to finish—so, again, your
operating system will invisibly interrupt your program so other things can
happen while the network operation is still ongoing.</p>
<section class="note" aria-role="note">
<p>Note: The video export is the kind of operation which is often described as
“CPU-bound” or “compute-bound”. It’s limited by the speed of the computer’s
ability to process data within the <em>CPU</em> or <em>GPU</em>, and how much of that speed
it can use. The video download is the kind of operation which is often
described as “IO-bound,” because it’s limited by the speed of the computer’s
<em>input and output</em>. It can only go as fast as the data can be sent across the
network.</p>
</section>
<p>In both of these examples, the operating system’s invisible interrupts provide a
form of concurrency. That concurrency only happens at the level of a whole
program, though: the operating system interrupts one program to let other
programs get work done. In many cases, because we understand our programs at a
much more granular level than the operating system does, we can spot lots of
opportunities for concurrency that the operating system cannot see.</p>
<p>For example, if we’re building a tool to manage file downloads, we should be
able to write our program in such a way that starting one download does not lock
up the UI, and users should be able to start multiple downloads at the same
time. Many operating system APIs for interacting with the network are
<em>blocking</em>, though. That is, these APIs block the program’s progress until the
data that they are processing is completely ready.</p>
<section class="note" aria-role="note">
<p>Note: This is how <em>most</em> function calls work, if you think about it! However,
we normally reserve the term “blocking” for function calls which interact with
files, the network, or other resources on the computer, because those are the
places where an individual program would benefit from the operation being
<em>non</em>-blocking.</p>
</section>
<p>We could avoid blocking our main thread by spawning a dedicated thread to
download each file. However, we would eventually find that the overhead of those
threads was a problem. It would also be nicer if the call were not blocking in
the first place. Last but not least, it would be better if we could write in the
same direct style we use in blocking code. Something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore does_not_compile">let data = fetch_data_from(url).await;
println!("{data}");</code></pre>
<p>That is exactly what Rust’s async abstraction gives us. Before we see how this
works in practice, though, we need to take a short detour into the differences
between parallelism and concurrency.</p>
<h3 id="parallelism-and-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#parallelism-and-concurrency">Parallelism and Concurrency</a></h3>
<p>In the previous chapter, we treated parallelism and concurrency as mostly
interchangeable. Now we need to distinguish between them more precisely, because
the differences will show up as we start working.</p>
<p>Consider the different ways a team could split up work on a software project. We
could assign a single individual multiple tasks, or we could assign one task per
team member, or we could do a mix of both approaches.</p>
<p>When an individual works on several different tasks before any of them is
complete, this is <em>concurrency</em>. Maybe you have two different projects checked
out on your computer, and when you get bored or stuck on one project, you switch
to the other. You’re just one person, so you can’t make progress on both tasks
at the exact same time—but you can multi-task, making progress on multiple
tasks by switching between them.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 17-1: A concurrent workflow, switching between Task A and Task B.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you agree to split up a group of tasks between the people on the team, with
each person taking one task and working on it alone, this is <em>parallelism</em>. Each
person on the team can make progress at the exact same time.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Concurrent work flow" src="img/trpl17-02.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-2: A parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With both of these situations, you might have to coordinate between different
tasks. Maybe you <em>thought</em> the task that one person was working on was totally
independent from everyone else’s work, but it actually needs something finished
by another person on the team. Some of the work could be done in parallel, but
some of it was actually <em>serial</em>: it could only happen in a series, one thing
after the other, as in Figure 17-3.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Concurrent work flow" src="img/trpl17-03.svg" class="center" />
<figcaption>Figure 17-3: A partially parallel workflow, where work happens on Task A and Task B independently until task A3 is blocked on the results of task B3.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Likewise, you might realize that one of your own tasks depends on another of
your tasks. Now your concurrent work has also become serial.</p>
<p>Parallelism and concurrency can intersect with each other, too. If you learn
that a colleague is stuck until you finish one of your tasks, you’ll probably
focus all your efforts on that task to “unblock” your colleague. You and your
coworker are no longer able to work in parallel, and you’re also no longer able
to work concurrently on your own tasks.</p>
<p>The same basic dynamics come into play with software and hardware. On a machine
with a single CPU core, the CPU can only do one operation at a time, but it can
still work concurrently. Using tools such as threads, processes, and async, the
computer can pause one activity and switch to others before eventually cycling
back to that first activity again. On a machine with multiple CPU cores, it can
also do work in parallel. One core can be doing one thing while another core
does something completely unrelated, and those actually happen at the same
time.</p>
<p>When working with async in Rust, we’re always dealing with concurrency.
Depending on the hardware, the operating system, and the async runtime we are
using—more on async runtimes shortly!—that concurrency may also use parallelism
under the hood.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dive into how async programming in Rust actually works! In the rest
of this chapter, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>see how to use Rust’s <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> syntax</li>
<li>explore how to use the async model to solve some of the same challenges we
looked at in Chapter 16</li>
<li>look at how multithreading and async provide complementary solutions, which
you can even use together in many cases</li>
</ul>

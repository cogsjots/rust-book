<p>Interestingly, the Rust language has <em>very</em> few concurrency features. Almost
every concurrency feature we’ve talked about so far in this chapter has been
part of the standard library, not the language. Your options for handling
concurrency are not limited to the language or the standard library; you can
write your own concurrency features or use those written by others.</p>
<p>However, two concurrency concepts are embedded in the language: the
<code>std::marker</code> traits <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code>.</p>
<h3 id="allowing-transference-of-ownership-between-threads-with-send"><a class="header" href="#allowing-transference-of-ownership-between-threads-with-send">Allowing Transference of Ownership Between Threads with <code>Send</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>Send</code> marker trait indicates that ownership of values of the type
implementing <code>Send</code> can be transferred between threads. Almost every Rust type
is <code>Send</code>, but there are some exceptions, including <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>: this cannot be
<code>Send</code> because if you cloned an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value and tried to transfer ownership
of the clone to another thread, both threads might update the reference count
at the same time. For this reason, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is implemented for use in
single-threaded situations where you don’t want to pay the thread-safe
performance penalty.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rust’s type system and trait bounds ensure that you can never
accidentally send an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value across threads unsafely. When we tried to do
this in Listing 16-14, we got the error <code>the trait Send is not implemented for Rc&lt;Mutex&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code>. When we switched to <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is <code>Send</code>, the code
compiled.</p>
<p>Any type composed entirely of <code>Send</code> types is automatically marked as <code>Send</code> as
well. Almost all primitive types are <code>Send</code>, aside from raw pointers, which
we’ll discuss in Chapter 20.</p>
<h3 id="allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync"><a class="header" href="#allowing-access-from-multiple-threads-with-sync">Allowing Access from Multiple Threads with <code>Sync</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>Sync</code> marker trait indicates that it is safe for the type implementing
<code>Sync</code> to be referenced from multiple threads. In other words, any type <code>T</code> is
<code>Sync</code> if <code>&amp;T</code> (an immutable reference to <code>T</code>) is <code>Send</code>, meaning the reference
can be sent safely to another thread. Similar to <code>Send</code>, primitive types are
<code>Sync</code>, and types composed entirely of types that are <code>Sync</code> are also <code>Sync</code>.</p>
<p>The smart pointer <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> is also not <code>Sync</code> for the same reasons that it’s not
<code>Send</code>. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type (which we talked about in Chapter 15) and the
family of related <code>Cell&lt;T&gt;</code> types are not <code>Sync</code>. The implementation of borrow
checking that <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> does at runtime is not thread-safe. The smart
pointer <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>Sync</code> and can be used to share access with multiple
threads as you saw in the <a href="ch16-03-shared-state.html#sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads">“Sharing a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> Between Multiple
Threads”</a><!-- ignore --> section.</p>
<h3 id="implementing-send-and-sync-manually-is-unsafe"><a class="header" href="#implementing-send-and-sync-manually-is-unsafe">Implementing <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> Manually Is Unsafe</a></h3>
<p>Because types that are made up of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> traits are automatically
also <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>, we don’t have to implement those traits manually. As
marker traits, they don’t even have any methods to implement. They’re just
useful for enforcing invariants related to concurrency.</p>
<p>Manually implementing these traits involves implementing unsafe Rust code.
We’ll talk about using unsafe Rust code in Chapter 20; for now, the important
information is that building new concurrent types not made up of <code>Send</code> and
<code>Sync</code> parts requires careful thought to uphold the safety guarantees. <a href="../nomicon/index.html">“The
Rustonomicon”</a> has more information about these guarantees and how to
uphold them.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This isn’t the last you’ll see of concurrency in this book: the whole next
chapter focuses on async programming, and the project in Chapter 21 will use the
concepts in this chapter in a more realistic situation than the smaller examples
discussed here.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, because very little of how Rust handles concurrency is
part of the language, many concurrency solutions are implemented as crates.
These evolve more quickly than the standard library, so be sure to search
online for the current, state-of-the-art crates to use in multithreaded
situations.</p>
<p>The Rust standard library provides channels for message passing and smart
pointer types, such as <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code>, that are safe to use in
concurrent contexts. The type system and the borrow checker ensure that the
code using these solutions won’t end up with data races or invalid references.
Once you get your code to compile, you can rest assured that it will happily
run on multiple threads without the kinds of hard-to-track-down bugs common in
other languages. Concurrent programming is no longer a concept to be afraid of:
go forth and make your programs concurrent, fearlessly!</p>
